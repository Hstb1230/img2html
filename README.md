# img2html
Through the PHP code to convert the image into the HTML page

[中文说明](https://github.com/Hstb1230/img2html/wiki)

Description
---
* The PHP code is written for uploading file.If you want to use in other scenes，please delete the first few lines code about judge upload files，and modify the value of ```$path```
* You need to open theGD extension，and set the value of```short_open_tag```
* You'd better use PHP version greater than 5.5 version, otherwise you do not support some format images(```webp```，```bmp```and so on)
* If you want to process bmp images, you must use a PHP version greater than or equal to ```7.2```.But I did not add the relevant code because I used PHP 5.6
